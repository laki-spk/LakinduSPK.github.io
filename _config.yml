Description: As a part of my post-doctoral research currently, I am working with Dr. Cui on identifying underlying mechanisms in heart regeneration by using in vivo screening, single cell data analysis and multi-omics at Harvard Medical school. I was a part of the DNA Damage Tolerance and Protein Engineering Lab under Dr. Beuning & the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Lab under Dr. Ondrechen at Northeastern University, I have worked on a wide variety of projects requiring a broad range of techniques. My thesis work centered around functional annotation of haloacid dehalogenases & characterizing cancer biomarkers with DNA polymerase kappa. These projects began with the use of computational tools to produce viable structural models, generate docking predictions, and conduct bioinformatics analysis, including intra- and inter-protein co-evolutionary analysis. I have 10+ years of research and development and 10+ peer-reviewed publications leading to the discovery of 5 novel enzymes and their directed evolution, 1 woodpecker species, 17 cancer biomarkers of DNA polymerases, tumor suppressor genes as biomarkers for the detection of cancers, and two inhibitory drugs targeted for the topoisomerase gene of Xoo. The wide range of skills and experiences that I have been exposed to make me an excellent candidate for post-doctoral studies.
