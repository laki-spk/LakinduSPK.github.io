Northeastern University - Research assistant – Chemistry Dpt. 
DNA damage & Tolerance | Computational & theoretical chemistry labs     2018 SEP - 2023 JAN
•	Worked under Dr. Penny Beuning and Dr. Mary Jo Ondrechen on Y family DNA polymerases and Haloacid dehalogenases.
•	Use of molecular visualization tools, bioinformatics machine learning techniques, & electro-statistics to predict & identify the activity of biomolecules; behavioral changes of protein-substrate activity at different pH levels, & molecular screening to predict bond lengths & best docking models. 
•	Established a new protocol to identify deleterious mutations associated with Human DNA polymerase kappa, Din B, DpO4 and DNA polymerase eta by using digital databases, molecular modeling, protein engineering, and machine learning electro statistics.
•	Performed in vitro protein engineering, site directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays and to identified activity DNA polymerase kappa and developed 17 cancer biomarkers.
•	Performed protein engineering to identify active site residues/ domains of DNA polymerase kappa and its orthologs Din B and DpO4 
•	Used machine learning in silico methods to predict the function of structural genomic proteins and validated in vitro biochemically and found 5 novel Haloacid dehalogenases. 
•	Performed kinetic analysis on Y family DNA polymerases and Haloacid dehalogenases to determine their activity.
•	Used HEK293T cell line of DNA polymerase kappa KO and WT to identify the effect of DNA polymerase kappa mutations. 
•	Use of various chromatography techniques, primer extension assays, kinetic assays, thermal stability, cell lines, and in-gel assays to identify, quantify, and validate the biochemical characterization of protein-protein/DNA/RNA/Ligand interaction of DNA polymerases and haloacid dehalogenases.
•	Excellent teamwork & collaboration skills, productive in cross-functional teams, and resource management demonstrated by managing EHS & multifaceted biochemical research projects, resulted in the development of two international collaborations and $1.2 million in grant funding.

Head TA
•	Served as an instructor & Head Teaching assistant for both laboratories and lecture recitations in general chemistry. These roles both required the ability to convey material in a clear and concise manner to ensure comprehension of topics. These courses teach fundamental understandings in chemistry and related laboratory skills, which involve proper handling of materials, scientific writing, and maintaining a proper lab notebook.
